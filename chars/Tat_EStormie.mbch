The military soldiers unswervingly loyal to the Emperor, Stormtroopers represented the most visible extension of Imperial might. They were shock troopers meant to strike with speed and accuracy, putting down insurrections and maintaining order on the far-flung worlds of the Empire. Stormtroopers served in both the ground-based armies of Palpatine's forces, and the space-based Imperial starfleet."
