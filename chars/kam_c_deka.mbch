These large, mobile weapons platforms were created by the Trade Federation to augment their legions of battle droids. Destroyer droids were built on a platform that could curl in upon itself in what was known as "Wheel Form," and roll into battle. Once deployed, the destroyer would unfold itself, steadying its massive form on three stout legs in what was known as the "Combat Stance." Its arms were studded with laser cannons and projectile launchers, and its head was filled with sensitive sensors and detectors used to local its targets."
