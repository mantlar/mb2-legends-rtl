V-59 Concussion Grenades: (1)

Details:

Chewbacca felt it only fitting to assist The Jedi Praxeum after being assisted by Jaden Korr on Tatooine. After hearing that Luke was assembling an attack force on a Cultist facility, he offered his own combat services. 'Chewie' carries a Wookiee Bowcaster as well as a few Concussion grenades for scattering enemies, but his primary weapons are his own two hands, or should I say claws. His physical strength makes him capable of tearing enemies to pieces and can amplify these features by entering a frenzy of strength and speed."
