description	"MacZombie's Cleaner

Weaponry:
Melee
DL-44   (3)

Attributes:
-Strength   (3)
-Extra Lives (2)

Using his trusty pistol, the Cleaner cleans up corpses and dirty food-stuffs, in fact, he's probably the only one person actually concerned with health, all the Imperials want to do is blow up MacZombies!
Of course, this means the Cleaner will be put out of work and with no-where to clean, he'll go insane. He's already insane, but the kind of 'no-work insanity' is a BAD kind of insane. Really bad. Unexplainable bad.
So he's willing to fight off the Imperials to keep his job and to keep MacZombies. Cleaner to lane 5 please!"
