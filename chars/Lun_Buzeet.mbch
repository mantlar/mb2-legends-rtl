Buz'eet Thudos is a typical Rodian bounty hunter, which means that he doesnt care how he kills his target, as long as he does.
Thudos mostly hunts rebel operatives with the help of his assassin-droid RAB-24.

Buz'eet and his droid had just landed at the Imperial lunar base to collect their payment for an earlier hunt, when they were informed that a vessel suspected of harboring rebels had just been captured.
Always in the mood for a fight, Buz'eet decided to aid the Imperial garrison(For a fee, of course!)."
