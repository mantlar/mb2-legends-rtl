Clone troopers were identical, genetically-modified soldiers bred and trained to serve in the Republic's army during the conflict that came to be known as the Clone Wars.
The Reverse Pulse Polarity grenade was a specialized weapon that emitted a reversing polarity pulse wave upon detonation that would literally crush droids caught within the blast radius of the grenade by overloading their systems."
