Description:
Dooku has brought along one of the more traditional, sturdier original battledroids. They lack the improved pistol, but have an improved blaster and an improved aim.
The units are not however, as widely produced as their standard counter-parts. They also lack the stronger body parts and better gryo-stabilisation systems of their counter-parts. Which basically means, they will be downed in a few shots, and can be knocked over by anything.
They are compensated by their ability to use explosives, which can prove very deadly."
