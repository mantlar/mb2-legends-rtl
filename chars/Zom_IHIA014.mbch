The Imperial Health Inspector Agent is trained in many different combat situations and has been taught how to stay uncover. These units tend to report directly to the high command officers rather than the Imperial Health Inspectors as they make the decisions.
They do have limited skill in combat as their main purpose is to be under cover, but these units can hold their own in a fair fight. This particular unit is trained in rapid evidence gathering and analysis, allowing him to move quickly through battle-zones and grab evidence before the enemy even knows what happened."
