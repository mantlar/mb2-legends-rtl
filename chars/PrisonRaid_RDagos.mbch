Out of the first three, he has the most abilities, subject X thanks him for them and has offered to kill him for us as he seems to think it’ll be a waste of a good fight but under protocol we cannot allow this. 0277 has; Powerful strength, the ability to pull and push living beings and if pull is mixed with push, can often kill people. He also has make himself invisible to the weak minded, drain the power out of other clones and jump great heights.
