Implosive Telekinetic Grip

Self Heal (1)

Keicho Darmal: test subject 0245. 0245 is the third of five powerful clones. He is the most peaceful of the five. Almost disturbing as he has very powerful abilities; he can shoot ‘explosive’ energy from long range and ‘implosive’ energy from a short distance. The explosive element is formed and fired from outside of his hand then propelled forward, the implosive is the same but formed inside his hand and in a grasping motion. We’ve learned how to use the explosive power to upgrade our storm commandos and containment troopers with blast armour, which, with the growing conention from our test subjects, may be a necessity."
