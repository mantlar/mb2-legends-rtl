Drex Nord: test subject X. Drex has shown signs of chaotic behavior since day one. When he was taken out of the bacta tank, he crushed it seemingly without even touching it. We believe that too much DNA mixing has given him a deeper, darker voice... I however believe that he just puts it on to intimidate us. He is the most powerful clone, matching only Dagos in ability. Although very fearsome, he does have his weaknesses... If I try to further experiment on him he’d kill me if he found out, though I must. His abilities include the powers of the other clones but some appear to be less potent. He has 0048’s great jumping and shockwave fists, 0121’s electrical energy, 0245’s implosive and explosive energy power and 0277’s push and strength. Drex has also shown signs of incredible speed."
