Life on Jakku is tough - it is a daily struggle for survival on the harsh planet. Ninteen-year-old Rey has carved out her existence on this bleak frontier world. Each day she has marked her victory over the searing sunlight, scorching sands and cutthroat scavengers with a scratch along the wall of her makeshift home. Thousands of scratches are a testament to her tenacity and survivor's instinct. Despite a life that should have built a barrier against any sympathy or weakness, Rey still possesses a generous heart and a willingness to help those in need."
