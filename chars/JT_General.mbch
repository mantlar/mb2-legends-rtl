Commander Appo,otherwise known as Clone Commander CC-1119.

Vader considered him one of the most elite of all commanders. 

The ARC Generals were given the very best training, and often gifted with a greater level of independance in their genetic programming than other clones.  

The Generals were responsible for the direction of large battalions of Clones, and in some cases even chose names for themselves, working side by side with the Jedi as individuals."
