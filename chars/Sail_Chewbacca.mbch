Equipment:
Pistol (1)

Attributes:
Strength (3)
Fury (1)
Ammo (2)

Chewie wouldn't have agreed to Luke's plan if Han Solo didn't need to be rescued, but the cocky corellian did, so Chewie went along, not sure what he was getting himself into.
Of course, now he realises what he has gotten himself into, or what Jabba plans to put him into anyway: The Sarlacc.
However Chewie has a chance to avoid this by killing the guards on the Sail Barge whilst Luke executes his plan on how to free them all."
