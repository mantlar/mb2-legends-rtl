Description:
To make sure the clones did not guess that the ship was in actual fact controlled by the separtists, he made sure to have a hired gun in clone armor (and also armed with clone weapons) to signal them on the video link.
With this in-mind, Dooku made sure that the ship was a neutral vessel - by default, clones would normally use their clone ships for transport, but for vital food supplies and other such required items, they use standard and common frieghters so separtists ships would be less likely to stop and destroy them.
However, since Dooku knew this, he could turn it to his advantage - by faking a distress signal from a neutral vessel, aimed at the base, from a fake clone pilot, he could be granted permission to land, and would sneak in the troops without the base knowing it until it's too late."
