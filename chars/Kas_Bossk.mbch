Bossk is an evil bounty hunter who works in the slave trade and skinning of wookiees, he usually prefers to work wookiees to death and then skin them, or even making it so wookiees turn on each other and kill each other, and then skinning the dead wookiees. 
Ruthless in his work, Bossk couldn't care if the next bounty was his best friend or an old pensioner, and as long he's paid for it with plenty of free flowing credits.
Bossk prefers to go for the weapons which causes the most pain whilst killing his target, to that effect Bossk carries a Disruptor rifle, poison darts and a themal detonator.
Not being one to take to weapons like the E-11, Bossk carries a Dlt-20a with him where ever he goes to back up his inhumane weapons and uses it to toy with his target."
