Clone troopers were identical, genetically-modified soldiers bred and trained to serve in the Republic's army during the conflict that came to be known as the Clone Wars.
During the Clone Wars, clone trooper sergeants were clone troopers bred on Kamino as sergeants in the Grand Army of the Republic. They were recognized by the green markings on their helmets and torso armor. They commanded squads of nine troops."
