Some imperial Technicians working on the deathstar managed to escape before the deathstar exploded. Those that did were picked up by the imperials and conscripted to aid the Imperial force assaulting the Yavin Base. Since they aren't trained to handle direct combat, these Technicians have instead been ordered to serve as supply runners. They can provide Medical equiptment, Ammunition, grenades, and sheilds for allies. They can also mount sentry turrets, portable sheilds, and Eweb Cannons."
