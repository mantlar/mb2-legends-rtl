Imperial officers were individuals, predominantly human, who held a position of authority and responsibility in the military forces, and some civilian elements, of the Galactic Empire. When the Empire succeeded the Galactic Republic after the end of the Clone Wars, some officers were tasked with leading the stormtroopers, the troops of the new regime."
