Description:
The support class is used in a majority of both famous and low-key bases around the galaxy. They are found everywhere on the battlefield and often aim to save those countless men from the face of death.
Their main role, as you might have guessed, is support. More importantly, assisting the weaker classes, or the classes in need of extra ammo that can't be provided by any other method. This can include heavy gunners."
