Details:

  Jovan Drark was one of the Jedi recruited by Luke Skywalker to train at the Praxeum on Yavin IV. He chooses to focus his skills in reconnaissance and scouting, and makes use of speed and mind trick to get through enemies unnoticed. Unfortunately, his abilities to defend himself with a lightsaber are limited, and he'll find himself in danger when placed into strong combat."
