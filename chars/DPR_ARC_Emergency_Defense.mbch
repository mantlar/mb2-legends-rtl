Description:
The Energency Defence Clone (EDC for short) is a class that has to maintain and back-up any of the defences that might go off-line in a base.
They man one portable shield generator, one portable gun turret and one Eweb. Their systems have an indepentant power supply and can back up any systems that fail in quick time.
It is also possible for them to set up defences where there were none preivously. However, due to short power supplies, the shields will drop after a period of time, and the turrets will self-destruct when power is low to avoid capture. "
