Jawas were passionate scavengers, combing the deserts of Tatooine for droids or scraps which they would capture and sell to the local residents, forming a codependent circle of trade. These opportunistic Jawas have agreed to aid the Rebels in their escape in the hopes of salaving the scrap left over from the Rebel's ship and whatever technology is left behind in the ensuing battle with the Imperials."
