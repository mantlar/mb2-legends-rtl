Description:
The clonetroopers are the standard footsoldiers for the Grand Army of the Republic. These units are specifically some of the older, more cumbersome troopers that were used.
The Alpha Clonetrooper uses a heavy repeater rifle to destroy all enemies with quick speed. However, this rifle has the disadvantage of combining the heavy weapons and light fire into one."
