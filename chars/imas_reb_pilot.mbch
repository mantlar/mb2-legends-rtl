Details:

Just a few of the X-wing Pilots are staying behind and helping defend the base until all of the equipment has been evacuated before leaving themselves.  The Rebel Pilots have very limited combat training, but are more resourceful than the average Rebel soldiers. They are trained in basic use of blaster weapons, but have limited ground combat experience."
