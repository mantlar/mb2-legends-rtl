description	"New Republic Security Droid

Summary: 
A tanky two-life gunner/brawler hybrid.

Weaponry:
- DH-17 (based on A280 3)
- Concussion Grenades (2)
- Wookiee style Melee

Attributes:
- Strength: (2)
- Assemble 
- Blast Armor
- Magnetic Plating
- Extra life
- Gunbash

 A fairly large host of abandoned/donated worker droids have been aquired by the Rebel Alliance over the years from many sources all over the galaxy, due to the Alliance's need of making due with whatever they can gather/salvage. Skilled Technicians have reprogrammed then to be far more competent in combat than they were previously, with the added benefit of then being considerably harder to destroy given their thick, magnetically plated, hazard resistant chassis."
