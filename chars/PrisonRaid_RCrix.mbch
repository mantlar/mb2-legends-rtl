General Crix Madine, founder and former leader of the notorious storm commandos. After witnessing first-hand the Empire's cruel and merciless tyranny, he defected to the Alliance, bringing with him the Empire's secrets. He became a valuable part of the Rebel Alliance, and would plan the sucessful raid of the second Death Star's shield generator on Endor. Crix Madine was known to fight alongside his troops, just as he did while leader of the storm commandos."
