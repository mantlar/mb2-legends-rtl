description	"B1 Battle Droid Sniper

Weaponry:
DL-44 (3)
E-5s sniper rifle

Attributes:
Armour (3)
Ammo (3)
Dodge (3)

B1s were perhaps the most numerous—and expendable—soldiers in galactic history, and, unlike most organic soldiers, they were capable of action in hostile environments like underwater or in space. They were designed to swamp their enemies with sheer numbers.
The BAW E-5s sniper rifle was a sniper rifle produced by Baktoid Armor Workshop and used by the droid snipers of the Separatist Droid Army."
