Born Padmé Naberrie, Queen Amidala was the formal name of the royal leader of Naboo.  As a child, Amidala was prodigiously talented and extremely well educated.  She had long been interested in public service, volunteering in the Refugee Relief Movement in her youth.  Her efforts helped in the Shadda-Bi-Boran exodus.  At the age of eight, she joined the Apprentice Legislature and became an Apprentice Legislator at age 11.  By 14, she was elected Queen of Naboo."
