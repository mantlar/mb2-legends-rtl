With the possible exception of the Rodians, no other species is better culturally suited to the profession of bounty hunting than the Trandoshans of the Kashyyyk system. These reptilian humanoids not only have strong builds and regenerative abilities that can regrow lost limbs, but their religious beliefs revolve around a god known as the Scorekeeper, who rewards successful hunts in the afterlife."
