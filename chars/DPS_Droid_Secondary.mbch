Description:
Dooku has brought along one of the more traditional, sturdier original battledroids. This is the secondary version of the original: It is faster, better armored, able to recover easily and has more explosives.
The advantages however end there. This unit is far less mass-produced (as the extra explosives meant a critical hit would blow up any units around it). The unit is also smaller, but this means it is less of a target.
The unit also lacks the gyro-stabilisation system of newer units, meaning it can fall down at anything, and the out-of-date, lighter armor plating means it will feel the brunt of anything."
