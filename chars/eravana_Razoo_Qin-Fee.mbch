A lieutenant to Tasu Leech, Razoo Qin-Fee was banned from the underworld Zygerrian fighting circuit for suspected cheating - a remarkable feat in a sport that has no rules. A pyromaniac and tech expert, Razoo maintains the hotchpotch weaponry and explosives favoured by the wild Kanjiklubbers, frequently upgrading and modifying their deadly tools of the trade to exacting and sinister specifications."
