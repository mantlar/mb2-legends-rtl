description	"Complaints Department Unit Two

Weaponry:
-Melee (3)
-PLX-1   (3)

Attributes:
-Stamina   (3)

This is the second level of MacZombie's complaints department. By using a different means of 'dealing effectively' with the complaints that are elevated, they are much more effective than the lower ranked first units. These units take a rocket launcher to answer any 'enquiries' into the MacZombie's food and what's inside it."
