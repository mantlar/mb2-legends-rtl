Kyle Katarn is an elite Rebel commando entrusted with some of the most crucial missions of the Rebel Alliance. When asked to escort an undercover vessel, Katarn assumed it to be a blue milk run. However, his asumptions were proven wrong when the vessel was discovered and captured by the Imperial garrison on a newly built lunar base."
