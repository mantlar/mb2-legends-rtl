Description:
A number of key people who had gotten the base's blueprints and keycodes out to the Separtists have been found out arrested by the Clone Army at the Base Delta Prime, and put in the detention area to await transport to a full-scale prison.
However, despite the convention rules of the fighting, the clones WILL execute any prisoner of war they cannot either relocate or evacuate onto a ship during an invasion. Since the base is going to be attacked when there is no escape ship availible, the prisoners will be executed.
But Dooku did not send in the spies without a plan of escape if they got caught - each spy has a small pack of an electrical disrupting explosive. It fits within the shoe of the spy, and unfolds into a much larger size. Once activated, it will disrupt the forcefield."
