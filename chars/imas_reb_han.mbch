Details:

The cocky Corellian was quickly caught up in the Rebel evacuation of Yavin IV.  Captain Solo needed to help Princess Leia evacuate Yavin, but found himself defending the base against the incoming Imperials.  With Chewie at his side he is practically unstoppable against the Imperials, and with the help of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, he should be able to hold them off long enough to get the important parts & personnel out of the base and onto a transport."
