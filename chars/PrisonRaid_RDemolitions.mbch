Rebel demolition or Plex troopers were specialized heavy weapons specialists in the Rebel Alliance's SpecForces. They used heavy weapons such as the PLX-1 launcher to destroy enemy air and ground vehicles. Due to their heavier armor, Plex Troopers were usually the slower-moving infantry on the battlefield. This was partially compensated by their heavy arsenals. Some were even seen in the Yavin Base before the Battle of Yavin waving Launch Rod Lights. "
