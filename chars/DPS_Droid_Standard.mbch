Description:
Knowing that the clone base has a fair number of clones to deal with, Dooku has brought along some battledroids to combat the main fighting force.
The battledroids have the ability to be stealthy but Dooku plans to use them as a distraction against the main fighting force whilst his crack troops sneak in.
Since battledroids fight unquestioningly, they will be a tough match for the clones."
