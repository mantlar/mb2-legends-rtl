Mercenaries were often said to have 'neutral' affiliation and were hired by many fighting forces, including the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire, without actually joining them. In some cases though, they grew sympathetic to their clients. Examples are Kyle Katarn, who eventually joined the Rebel Alliance, and Boba Fett, who was often known as Vader's right-hand man."
