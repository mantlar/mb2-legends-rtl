Weaponry:
Pistol (1)
High-Velocity Rifle (Hitscan Projectile Rifle)

Attributes:
Ammo (3)
Bacta (50HP+)
Self Heal (1)
Armor (2)

The Imperial Sniper is a model of Imperial efficiency. Highly trained and deadly with his weapon of choice, he eliminates targets without pity or remorse, viewing each shot taken as a step towards a better galaxy. His fanatical devotion and strict professionalism leave him as a feared opponent for any enemy of the Empire. 

The Imperial Sniper is always looking for an edge in battle, and the Empire's new experimental High-Velocity Rifle is just the edge he is looking for. It is a weapon designed to combat the popular Tenloss Disruptor Rifle often used by those of the criminal underworld. The only drawback is the weapon is far heavier than a traditional projectile rifle, leaving the Imperial Sniper to rely more on his aim than on the advanced acrobatics that snipers usually have available to them."
