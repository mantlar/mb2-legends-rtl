Prudii Skirata, formerly known as Null-5 or N-5 was one of six Null-class ARC troopers created for use in the Grand Army of the Republic as a lieutenant. Due to the genetic tampering, Prudii and his five brothers had slightly improved muscular structures, eidetic memory, and an enhanced intelligence that was at least a 35% higher intelligence score over the ordinary clones.
When he and the other Nulls were two years old, Kal Skirata saved them from termination by the Kaminoan clone scientists. Since then, they were only loyal to Kal Skirata."
