One of Jabba's many prisoners who want to strongly avoid being eaten by the Sarlacc. They have taken advantage of the confusion caused by Luke Skywalker and are now overthrowing guards and taking their weapons.
These prisoners are willing to get back at the people who wanted them to be Fed to Sarlacc, so expect plenty of action with these guys."
